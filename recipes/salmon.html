    <h1>Air fryer salmon
    </h1>
    <p>Salmon fillets cook beautifully in an air fryer and make a delicious meal when coated in a herb seasoning and
        served with greens and grains</p>

    <h4>Ingredients</h4>
    <ul>
        <li>1 tsp salt</li>
        <li>1 tsp pepper</li>
        <li>1 tsp mixed herbs</li>
        <li>1 tsp garlic granules (optional)</li>
        <li>4 salmon fillets (we used 4 x 130g fillets), skin on or removed</li>
        <li>½ tbsp olive oil</li>
    </ul>
    <h4>Steps</h4>
    <ol>
        <li>Combine the salt, pepper, mixed herbs and garlic granules, if using, in a bowl, then scatter onto a plate.
            Rub each salmon fillet with a little olive oil and roll in the seasoning to coat.</li>
        <li>Put in the air fryer basket in one layer and cook at 180C for 8-10 mins, until cooked through. If you have
            larger salmon fillets they will need to be cooked for longer – keep checking after 10 mins and cook in 1-2
            min blasts, until ready. Serve with greens and quinoa or rice, if you like.</li>
    </ol>
