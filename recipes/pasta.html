        Season the chicken as desired. Heat the oil in a 12-inch skillet over
        medium-high heat. Add the chicken and cook until well browned,
        stirring often. Remove the chicken from the skillet.

        Add the onion to the skillet and cook until tender-crisp, stirring
        occasionally. Add the wine and heat to a boil, stirring to scrape up
        any browned bits from the bottom of the skillet.

        Stir in the tomatoes, Swanson Chicken Broth, penne, and water; heat to
        a boil. Reduce the heat to medium. Cook for 10 minutes or until the
        penne is tender, stirring occasionally. Return the chicken to the
        skillet. Cook for 2 minutes or until the chicken is cooked through.
